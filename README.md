# Product-Sales-Outlet-at-BigMart-Datawarehouse
### Problem Statement:  
1. The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. The products and stores have also been defined based on certain attributes.   
2. The goal of this data science project is to build a predictive model and determine the sales of each product at a particular store.   
3. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.
